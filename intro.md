good morning everyone, hope u all r doing good

intro:: names, title::interaction based learning

our main motive behind this project was to communicate with the deaf and dumb easily. 
we have created a platform for users to learn ASL and communicate easily and freely with the dead and dumb.
this is important towards knowing the feelings and thought processes of the deaf and dumb.

u may ask why we have created this platform when there are videos already present on the internet to learn actions and gestures from?
this is because we have created a gamified approach towards teaching users signs making it more interesting for the users to learn from.
not only will this game entertain better but also the user can easily learn the actions or gestures from the NPCs present in the Game .

Gamified approach is mainly required to make the platform more interesting and keeping the user always engaged and interested towards the platform.

video explainations of the actions are usually boring to learn from and also confusing for users to accurately learn the actions. 
this game keeps the users active as they have to learn the action sideBy and perform it making sure that the action has been learnt by the user.
we have a confidence score that describes the accuracy of the action being performed by the user.
